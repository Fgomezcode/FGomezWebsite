<h5>Goal.</h5>
<p>
    I set out to create a program that will generate guitar scales, chord progressions and keys. 
    The goal was to abstract away music theory, and notation and be flexible in terms of tuning and string count. 
    By not limiting the program to standard guitar tunings and string count the information generated applies to a variety of stringed instruments.
    <br>
    <br>
    Aside from generating keys and scales, I wanted to make the program accessible to users of all skill levels. 
    This is done by displaying the scales in tablature on a 'fretboard' as well as including 3 notations for chord progressions.

<h5>Hurdles.</h5>
    <p>
        One of the first hurdles was figuring out what information I needed up front and what could be done programmatically.
         The original solution was to create all 41 scales, fretboards and progressions for each of the 12 chromatic notes, and store them in a local JSON file.
          Using the root note provided by the user the corresponding object would be accessed and its data would be displayed.
           However, with such a large file it would become difficult to make corrections or modifications without making more work for myself.
        <br>
        <br>

        The solution I ended up with split the original idea into a few parts. The first was to limit the data generated to the root note.
         Since we are only generating information for one note, we only have to create one list of notes and simply manipulate which notes get displayed.
          Secondly, the information stored locally is reduced to 'step notation', name and chord notation. 
        Instead of worrying about managing a library of notes and scales I now only had to manage a sequence of letters.
        <br>
        <br>

        This change in approach essentially changed the program I was writing. Rather than focus on data management I was now focused on writing algorithms that would translate step notation.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here's a brief example using the root note of C.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Chromatic scale starting at C: C - C# - D - D# - E - F - F# - G- G# - A - A# - B - C
            </li>
            <li>
                Major scale steps: W - W - H - W - W - W â€“ H <br>
                Each step(H) is a semi-tone, a whole step(W) is 2 semi-tones <br>
                (tonal values: 2,2,1,2,2,2,1)
            </li>
            <li>
                C + W = D, D + W = E, E + H = F, F + W = G, G + W = A, A + W = B, B + H = C
            </li>
            <li>
               Final Scale = CDEFGABC
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    <p>
        Using a root note and tonal values of step notation we can quickly index through a list of notes and generate the desired scales in a given key. 
        Once this list is generated we can then use the chord notation to pull necessary notes for each chord progression. A basic 1 - 4 - 5 progression in zero index is 0 - 3 - 4.

<h5>What I learned.</h5>
    <p>
        Ultimately I traded off data management for an increase in runtime operations. 
        But, because I was able to reduce the actual amount of work required to generate the desired information the project became lighter and more flexible.
        <br>
        <br>
        But why would I choose this trade-off?
        <br><br>

        There are a finite number of combinations when it comes to creating scales.
        Since we are limiting the program to one root note, scales to a length of 8 notes, and working in 2 semi-tones there are at most 256 possible scales to generate per root note and a total of 3072 scales for all 12 chromatic notes. 
        If we include scales ranging from 1 note to 8 notes there are 510 scales per root note and 6120 possible scales in total. 
        Of course, not all of the scales will sound good or make sense musically. 
        In its current iteration, the program can generate all 6120 scales in ~2 seconds, and the maximum of 256 scales per root note in .14 seconds.
        <br>
        <br>

        Dealing with that much information is impractical, it makes error-checking difficult and limits the scope of the program. 
        If we wanted to change the tuning or number of strings we would have to hardcode every possible iteration of all 6120 scales. 
        Each minor change makes the scale 'library' grow exponentially. 
        By programmatically generating the data we can create scales in any tuning for instruments with any number of strings. 
        We can generate as many or as few scales as we want with minimal information. 
        We can quickly check for errors and making corrections to a few functions is faster and easier than making changes to individual entries.
